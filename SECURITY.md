## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Marketing Factory OSS team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving 
the security of our open source software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every 
effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the Atomist security team at:

    security@marketing-factory.der

**IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities**

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 72 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 
additional 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the 
security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for 
additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English or German.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will 
coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
* Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
* Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible to the 
specific projects.
